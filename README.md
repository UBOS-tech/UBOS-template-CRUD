This template is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to manage a product list. It has several HTTP endpoints to handle different operations:

/createProduct: POST request to create a new product record. It requires product name, price, and optionally rating in the request body.
/getProducts: GET request to retrieve all product records from the database.
/updateProduct: PUT request to update an existing product record. It requires the product ID and updated fields in the request body.
/deleteProduct: DELETE request to remove a product record from the database by its ID.

Additionally, the template includes an AI-powered bulk create feature with the /AIBulkCreate endpoint. This endpoint takes a prompt from the user and interacts with the OpenAI API to generate parameters for creating multiple product records based on the prompt and the /createProduct API documentation. The generated parameters are then used to make requests to the /createProduct endpoint, effectively allowing users to create multiple product records at once using natural language input.
The application uses MongoDB as the database to store product records. The database connection details are configured using environment variables.
Overall, this Node-RED template provides a fully functional CRUD application for managing a product list, with the added capability of bulk creation using AI-powered natural language processing.
